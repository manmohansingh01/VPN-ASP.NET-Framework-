# VPN-ASP.NET-Framework-C#
In this repository you will find  the code for creating a vpn application using C#.
It is configured for connecting to both UDP and TCP connections.
I have used Open VPN , Putty , FileZilla.
Also a platform where a server can be hosted is needed like AWS or Digital Ocean.
